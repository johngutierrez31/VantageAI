# Cyber Range Design and Implementation

Design, build, and operate high-fidelity virtualized cyber ranges that maximize training value through realistic adversary simulation and enterprise environment replication.

## When to Use

- Designing new cyber range architectures
- Planning cyber warfare exercises
- Evaluating range infrastructure requirements
- Implementing zone-based network topologies
- Integrating NPC traffic generation
- Planning ICS/SCADA/OT range components
- Assessing range fidelity and realism
- Designing exercise automation and orchestration
- Planning cloud vs. on-premise range deployment

## When NOT to Use

- Production security infrastructure design (use standard enterprise architecture)
- Penetration testing methodology (use red team skills)
- Detection engineering without range context (use purple-teaming skill)
- Incident response procedures (use IR-specific frameworks)

## Core Concept

A cyber range is a fully interactive virtual instance of enterprise IT infrastructure dedicated to cyberwarfare training. Realism is the primary driver of training value—ranges must support "train as you fight" principles.

| Fidelity Level | Characteristics | Training Value |
|----------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Low | Basic networking, minimal services, no traffic | Limited—trivial to detect adversary |
| Medium | Core services, basic policies, scripted traffic | Moderate—builds tool familiarity |
| High | Production-replica configs, realistic NPCs, proper noise | High—develops operational intuition |
| Ultra | Threat intel-driven TTPs, adaptive adversary AI, full telemetry | Elite—nation-state operator development |

## Infrastructure Requirements

### Compute Sizing

| Scale | VMs | vCPU | RAM | Notes |
|-------|-----|------|-----|-------|
| Small (training) | 50-100 | 200-400 | 256-512 GB | Single team exercises |
| Medium (exercise) | 100-500 | 500-2000 | 1-4 TB | Multi-team force-on-force |
| Large (enterprise) | 500-2000 | 2000-8000 | 4-16 TB | Full enterprise simulation |
| Massive (national) | 2000+ | 8000+ | 16+ TB | Nation-state level exercises |

### Storage Architecture

| Tier | Technology | Purpose | IOPS Target |
|------|------------|---------|-------------|
| Hot | NVMe/SSD | Active VMs, snapshots | 100K+ |
| Warm | SSD/HDD Hybrid | Golden images, recent backups | 10K-50K |
| Cold | HDD/Object | Archives, long-term retention | 1K-5K |

**Critical**: Storage must support instant snapshot and rapid clone operations for range resets.

### Network Requirements

| Requirement | Specification |
|-------------|---------------|
| Core bandwidth | 10+ Gbps between hypervisors |
| VLAN capacity | 1000+ VLANs for team isolation |
| Isolation | Air-gap or strict firewall from production |
| Monitoring | SPAN/TAP ports for packet capture |

## Machine Image Strategy

### Image Count Minimization

Keep total unique images low to reduce maintenance burden:

| Category | Recommended Images | Notes |
|----------|-------------------|-------|
| Windows Server | 2-3 | 2019/2022, DC vs. member |
| Windows Workstation | 2 | Win10/11 variants |
| Linux Server | 3-4 | Ubuntu, CentOS/Rocky, Debian, specialty |
| Network Appliances | Per-vendor | Often require manual config |
| Security Tools | As needed | SIEM, EDR, IDS/IPS |

### Image Design Principles

1. **Generic base images** accepting IaC configuration
2. **Parameterized deployment** (hostname, IP, domain join via cloud-init/Sysprep)
3. **No sensitive data** in images (production clones require sanitization)
4. **Patch synchronization process** for ongoing maintenance

### Automation Trade-offs

| Component | Automation Feasibility | Notes |
|-----------|----------------------|-------|
| Windows/Linux VMs | High | Terraform, Ansible, cloud-init |
| AD/LDAP population | High | PowerShell, Python scripts |
| Network topology | Medium | Depends on hypervisor API |
| Vendor appliances | Low-Medium | Often require manual licensing |
| Security tool configs | Low-Medium | Vendor-specific APIs vary |

## Realism Drivers

### Traffic Generation (NPC Simulation)

Without background traffic, adversary activity is trivially detectable.

| Traffic Type | Implementation | Fidelity Impact |
|--------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Web browsing | Selenium/Playwright bots | Medium |
| Email | SMTP traffic generation | Medium |
| File access | SMB/NFS activity scripts | Medium |
| Application use | Protocol-specific generators | High |
| **LLM-driven NPCs** | Behavioral AI simulation | Ultra-high |

### Configuration Depth

| Layer | Low Fidelity | High Fidelity |
|-------|--------------|---------------|
| Firewall | Allow all | Production ACLs |
| AD | Default policies | GPOs matching production |
| SIEM | Basic collection | Full correlation rules |
| EDR | Passive mode | Active blocking |
| DNS | Basic resolution | Split-horizon, internal zones |

### Adversary Realism

| Level | Characteristics |
|-------|-----------------|
| Script kiddie | Public exploits, noisy, single-stage |
| Criminal | Commodity malware, basic evasion, financial motive |
| APT | Custom tooling, living-off-the-land, multi-stage |
| Nation-state | Zero-days, supply chain, long-term persistence |

## Cloud vs. On-Premise Decision Matrix

| Factor | On-Premise | Cloud |
|--------|------------|-------|
| **Initial cost** | High (hardware) | Low (pay-as-you-go) |
| **Operating cost** | Lower long-term | Higher (egress, sustained use) |
| **Setup time** | Weeks-months | Hours-days |
| **Image library** | Build yourself | Vendor-provided |
| **Isolation** | Physical air-gap possible | Logical isolation only |
| **Scalability** | Limited by hardware | Effectively unlimited |
| **Control** | Full | Constrained by provider |
| **Compliance** | Easier for classified | May require GovCloud |

### Cloud Cost Model

```
Monthly Cost = (Compute Hours × Rate) + (Storage GB × Rate) + (Egress GB × Rate)

Example (AWS, 100-VM range, 8 hours/day, 20 days/month):
- Compute: 100 VMs × 8h × 20d × $0.10/h = $1,600
- Storage: 5 TB × $0.10/GB = $500
- Egress: 500 GB × $0.09/GB = $45
- Total: ~$2,145/month
```

## Reset and Snapshot Strategy

### Reset Levels

| Level | Scope | Time | Use Case |
|-------|-------|------|----------|
| VM snapshot revert | Single VM | Seconds | Quick undo |
| Team enclave reset | All VMs in team | Minutes | Between exercise rounds |
| Full range reset | Entire range | 30-60 min | Exercise restart |
| Golden image redeploy | Full rebuild | Hours | Major changes |

### Implementation Approaches

1. **Snapshot trees**: Pre-exercise snapshots at known-good state
2. **Linked clones**: Storage-efficient copies from golden images
3. **IaC redeploy**: Terraform destroy/apply for full rebuild
4. **Differential restore**: Restore only modified VMs

## ICS/SCADA/OT Integration

### Integration Methods

| Method | Complexity | Fidelity |
|--------|------------|----------|
| Software simulation | Low | Low-Medium |
| Hardware-in-the-loop | Medium | High |
| Full physical testbed | High | Ultra |

### Connectivity Options

| Physical Device Type | Integration Method |
|---------------------|-------------------|
| TCP/IP managed | Direct VLAN connection |
| Serial-only | Serial-to-IP converter |
| Air-gapped | KVM-over-IP |
| Proprietary protocol | Protocol gateway |

### Virtualization Platforms

| Platform | License | Best For |
|----------|---------|----------|
| VMware vSphere | Commercial | Enterprise ranges, full features |
| Proxmox VE | Open source | Cost-sensitive, Linux-centric |
| OpenStack | Open source | Large scale, cloud-like |
| AWS/Azure/GCP | Commercial | Rapid deployment, scalability |
| **Docker/Podman** | Open source | Lightweight ranges, rapid iteration, CI/CD integration |

### Docker-Based Ranges

Docker provides a lightweight alternative for specific range use cases:

**Advantages:**
- Sub-second container startup vs. minutes for VMs
- Minimal resource overhead (no hypervisor layer)
- Version-controlled infrastructure (Dockerfiles as IaC)
- Native CI/CD integration for automated testing
- Easy distribution via container registries

**Limitations:**
- Shared kernel limits OS diversity (Linux-only without nested VMs)
- No true Windows workstation simulation
- Network isolation less robust than VLANs
- Some security tools expect full OS environment

**Best Use Cases:**
- Grey zone services (DNS, web, mail)
- Red team infrastructure (C2, redirectors)
- NPC traffic generators
- Security tool evaluation
- Training environments for Linux-focused exercises
- Rapid prototyping before VM deployment

**Hybrid Approach:**
Combine Docker for lightweight services with VMs for full-fidelity endpoints:
```
Blue Zone: VMs (Windows AD, workstations, SIEM)
Grey Zone: Docker (DNS hierarchy, web farms, mail)
Red Zone: Docker (C2 servers, attack tools)
White Zone: Docker (automation, APIs)
```
